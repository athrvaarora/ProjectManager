# Firebase Deployment Commands

# First, make sure you're logged in to Firebase
firebase login

# Then, deploy the updated Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project workflow-fc691

# If you don't have the Firebase CLI installed globally, you can use npx
npx firebase-tools login
npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules --project workflow-fc691

# Note: The updated Firestore rules fix the permission issue by:
# 1. Improving the isOrgCreator function to handle cases where the organization document doesn't exist yet
# 2. Updating the organizations collection rules to allow users to create and update their own organizations
# 3. Adding explicit rules for the invites collection

# After deploying these rules, you should be able to save your organization chart successfully.
