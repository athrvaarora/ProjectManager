Phase 6: Deployment and Optimization
Finally, let's deploy the application and optimize it for enterprise use:
Phase 6 Prompt for Cursor:
CopyLet's prepare our enterprise workflow system for deployment on GCP and optimize it for production use.

1. Set up GCP infrastructure:
   - Configure Firestore/Datastore for database
   - Set up Google Cloud Storage for file storage
   - Configure Cloud Functions for serverless operations
   - Set up Cloud Run for the main application

2. Implement security measures:
   - Proper IAM roles and permissions
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - API key management and rotation
   - Security audit logging

3. Optimize AI model usage:
   - Implement token caching strategies
   - Create model fallback hierarchies (GPT-4 â†’ GPT-3.5)
   - Batch similar requests where possible
   - Implement exponential backoff for rate limits

4. Create monitoring and analytics:
   - Set up Cloud Monitoring dashboards
   - Implement error tracking and alerting
   - Create usage analytics for AI operations
   - Set up performance monitoring

5. Implement enterprise features:
   - Multi-tenant architecture
   - Data isolation between organizations
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Compliance documentation

Use Terraform for infrastructure as code and implement CI/CD with Cloud Build.
After implementing Phase 6, you should have:

A fully deployed application on GCP
Secure infrastructure with proper monitoring
Optimized AI model usage with fallbacks
Enterprise-grade security and compliance
