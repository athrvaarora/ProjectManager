i want to build a enterprise level application but first lets discuss the requirements in the project ,

first user can either use their email and password to Sign-up/Sign-in or their gmail account or their

sso based login like work email and stuff add an email verification layer for first time account

creators with a 6 digit otp or a passkey each user will have their own unique instance and can log

back in later like any other app,

secondly once created the account or login is successful for first time(Created a new account and

logging in ) users  user will go to the next page where it will show 2 options create an organization

chart or join an organization whereas it will directly go to dashboard if this is not their first time

logging in and they have either already entered their organization invite code and joinded the project

or they have previously created an organization chart which will be later described

1. `	 `If a user clicks on create an organization chart button, it will open an open a drag and drop

interface where user can select from 3-4 types of component

1. `	`(5 field boxes for defining people part of the organization),
1. `	`Arrows to connect different part of team together.
1. `	`A hierarchical arrow if there is someone a person is reporting to and updates will be set out

to them.

1. `	 `Or a single box in case if there’s any fine tuning is needed while referencing a particular

person in the organization.

( first being 5 fields box where user will add

1. `	`Person’s name  in the organization.
1. `	`email address of the person(we will send invite to this person through email with a alpha

numeric access code and a link to webpage where they can use it and create an account from this

email and on next page instead of creating an organization chart button they can click on join an

organization and enter the given access code in the email),

1. `	`their email address that they have on jira( this will be primary goal of the project as after

creating the organization structure user will enter the project description and parameters and

deadlines and scrum schedule and stuff like that , we will use ai to generate a detailed workflow on

how to go about approach this task  and finish this by deadline, in this step the person creating can

edit the workflow add steps to this workflow or manage this by changing the order of the flow make

this completely editable make sure this flow meets industry standards of development oce the flow

is finalized and submitted and along with this they can enter if there;s any deadline or how urgent it

is along with timeframe they can mark if there’s any step until which they would like iutil some

particular step to be complete user can completely customize each step in workflow , we will use ai

analyze it wit lots of tokens and help it make smart decisions  how many stories and jira related

stuff we will need to finish this task this step is also completely editable make it customizable every

step of the way for the manager if they wanna edit number of story points and make sure its being

given storis considering all the previous parameters, and on the next page it will give them an option

to import this ticket directly into their jira once tickets are checked off from jira they should be

checked off here as well )

1. `	`Their role in the organization(This will be text based input this can be like Sr Manager,

Software developer and stuff  we all this data in these 5 fields the hierchy and the proficiency of

people in the organization will be used to build a detailded prompt and promperly engineered

prompt and even on the next page the input we are taking about deadlines and stuff will be used by

open ai with lots of tokens to generate the detailed workflows of the project and what task will be

assigned to everyone in the organization and their generated jira ticket role can also be like a

mediator between 2 people or someone who just checks up if they are  a higher up all these inputs

will play a role in perfect prompt to generate prompt required worflopw)

1. `	 `their proficiency that they have in different languages and frameworks, and what they

primary used to work in the organization)

Arrows to connect different part of team together.

1. `	`This is primarily used to connect people who will be be part of the team working on the

project. Someone who is not connected to with these arros is not part of the working team and they

will not be part of  team when we will distribute task from each step of workflow they can be an

observer or admin they will use different arrows which will be discussed later)

A hierarchical arrow if there is someone a person is reporting to and updates will be set out to them.

1. `	`This will primarily be used to connect who are just observers and will receive updates on

completing of workflow steps this is a distinct arrow as compared to previous arrow as these

people will not be assigned tasks or jira tickets  this is mostly so admin can watch over the project

progress

Or a single box in case if there’s any fine tuning is needed while referencing a particular person in

the organization.

1. `	`This will be used to fine tune relationships between team members or define or fine tune

the prompt itself this can be used to even mention if someone will be out during like 2-3 days and

the ai model will take consideration while generating workflow, assigning workloads and generating

tickets.

b.	If after login user selects join an organization instead of creating an organization option

these will be people who were added by someone when they created an organization and they will

receive and email to signup and will have a alpha numeric code which will be generated for them to

join the organization.  And once this is verified user will go to dashboard which we will discuss later.

Once this page is complete lets move on to what happens when the user creates and organizational

chart and all the invites are now sent and we have their jira info as well which we will use to send

out tickets later, now on this page, User will have a form like interface which will have all the fields a

customer end representative would ask a client like project title, detailed project description,

design specifications if any, method of deployment , duration like start date and end date of project

if these any stage that they would like to be done by what date, they can mark it if its urgent or add a

firm due date for some particular completion goal , their setup inftastructure and stuff think if

there;s any other filed a coustomer end representative at a software dev company would ask client

for and fill out to the team manager something like this Project Identification

Which will be multiple pages for the person from organization will enter detail about the project

mark the fields are mandatory and not mandatory as needed once we take this input step by step.

At this point

We have organization structure and lots of info about how the organization team is structured what

are different people in the organization are responsible for , what are they proficient in and they

primarily work towards, and now we also have detailed description of the project that this team /

organization will be building together (Store all the previous data and all the data will be passed to

agents) Use multi agent approach for better results with access to our database using all this info

we want to fine tune llms create a vector database and fine tune it use multi agent system if

necessary to generate industry level workflow which will be  like all the steps/ milestones/ projects

that will be taken build this project it will be like a connected list and clickable as well and it will

have dated milestones based on info about deadlines and deliverables when you click on it it will

dispay primary task of this and it will show list of people who will be working towards completing

this milestone, you can click on them to open a page to see how many tickets will be their in that

particular milestone and how many story points and stuff as well, for any employee the person

entering this stuff can click on edit button and change this values, back on workflow page as well

person can add and remove people working on that milestone and the jira tickets will be changed

accordingly all the steps in the workflow are also editable including the dates the order of

development and stuff except in case of uegent tasks some of the steps are restricted any changes

made in workflow like rearranging the order or editing dates or number of people will also  assign an

agent to keep on generating updated tasks and tickets and story points after each edit to anything in

the workflow. Use multiple agents synced together to with all the information that we collected

from organizations and projects data and using fine tune llm’s to generate updated tickets and

stories after every change so manager or person who is creating this organization can see and

review them and submit them. Once completed, each person in the organization along with the

person who created this organization chart ( The people who got invite email will sign up using that

work email and use the organization code provided in email to join the organization, and they will

come on dashboard

On dashboard they will have a chatgpt like previous chat interface for with previously build

organizational chart with create new organization button on top left corner.  On dashboard there

would be a first option to import the tickets generated to their jira first there would be a button that

they can see for connect your jira to import tickets when the do it for the first time and upon clicking

that button in center of screen it will redirect them to authenticate their account and use the email

that we got from them during creating of org charts user will log in and all the jira related stuff would

be imported to their jira at this time. Once the jira have tickets imported our dashboard will

basically acts as a analytic dashboard with tracking stuff from their jira about milestone

completetion, upcoming deadlines  and use open ai model with detailed prompt engineering to

generate a complete roadmap to filfill each step of the development process It will be like similar

cards like structure that one can click on and it will give them steps on how to finish that subtask

towards completion of the milestone and the progress can be tracked, all the people including

observers/admin can see progress of each others milestones

Enterprise-Level Workflow Management System

Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture and functionality of an enterprise-level

application focused on organizational workflow management, team collaboration, and automated

task allocation. The platform integrates with Jira for seamless project management and leverages AI

to generate customized workflows based on organizational structure and project requirements. The

system provides a unified solution for organizations to design their hierarchical structures, define

project parameters, and automatically generate industry-standard workflows with appropriate task

assignments.

System Overview

The application serves as a centralized platform for organizations to map their structure, define

projects with detailed specifications, and generate optimized workflows with automated task

assignment. By collecting extensive data about team members' roles, proficiencies, and

relationships, the system creates tailored project plans that align with organizational capabilities

and project requirements. Integration with Jira enables seamless task management and progress

tracking, while the AI-driven workflow generation ensures efficient resource allocation and realistic

timelines.

Core Components and User Flow

1. Authentication and Account Management

The system offers multiple authentication methods to accommodate various organizational

security preferences:

- `	`Email and password registration with 6-digit OTP verification for first-time users
- `	`Gmail account integration for simplified authentication
- `	`SSO-based login using corporate email credentials
- `	`Passkey support for enhanced security

Each user maintains a unique account instance that persists between sessions, allowing them to

return to their personalized dashboard upon subsequent logins. This multi-faceted approach to

authentication ensures both security and convenience, catering to different organizational

requirements while maintaining robust verification procedures.

2\. Organization Onboarding

Upon successful authentication, the system presents users with a contextual landing experience:

For First-Time Users: Users are prompted to either create a new organization chart or join an

existing organization using an invitation code.

For Returning Users: The system automatically directs users to their dashboard, displaying their

existing organization chart or the organization they've previously joined.

2\.1 Organization Chart Creation

When creating an organization chart, users access an intuitive drag-and-drop interface featuring

several component types:

Personnel Component (5-Field Box):

- `	`Person's full name (for identification within the system)
- `	`Corporate email address (used for sending invitations with unique access codes)
- `	`Jira email address (for integration with existing project management tools)
- `	`Organizational role (such as Senior Manager, Software Developer, QA Engineer)
- `	`Technical proficiencies (languages, frameworks, and primary work responsibilities)

These comprehensive personnel details are critical for the AI-driven workflow generation, as they

inform task assignment based on expertise and capacity.

Team Connection Arrows: These arrows establish working relationships between team members,

explicitly defining who will collaborate on project tasks. Team members connected by these arrows

are considered active participants in the project execution and will receive task assignments in the

generated workflows.

Hierarchical Reporting Arrows: Distinct from team connection arrows, these indicate reporting

relationships where certain members serve as observers or administrators. These stakeholders

receive milestone updates and completion notifications but are not assigned direct

implementation tasks. This distinction ensures proper information flow while maintaining clear

boundaries for task responsibility.

Annotation Box: This component allows for additional context and special considerations, such as:

- `	`Temporary unavailability of team members
- `	`Special relationship dynamics between personnel
- `	`Additional context for AI workflow generation
- `	`Exceptions or special circumstances to consider in planning

This feature ensures that the AI model accounts for real-world constraints and team nuances when

generating workflows and assigning tasks.

2\.2 Joining an Existing Organization

Users who receive invitation emails can create accounts and join organizations using the provided

alphanumeric access codes. Upon verification, these users gain immediate access to the

organization dashboard with appropriate permissions based on their defined role in the

organization chart.

Comprehensive Prompt for Multi-Agent AI Architecture

Here's a detailed prompt to set up the multi-agent architecture using OpenAI's models:

CopyI'm implementing a multi-agent AI system for generating project workflows based on

organizational structure and requirements. Design a system with the following components:

1. Agent Orchestration Architecture:
- Controller Agent (GPT-4 Turbo): Coordinates all other agents, processes high-level requests,

maintains context, and ensures coherent responses

- Organization Analyzer (GPT-3.5 Turbo): Processes organizational chart data, identifies team

relationships, skills assessment

- Requirements Analyzer (GPT-4o): Processes project requirements, extracts key constraints,

objectives, and dependencies

- Workflow Generator (GPT-4 Turbo): Creates detailed workflow with milestones, tasks, and

dependencies

- Task Assigner (GPT-3.5 Turbo): Matches tasks to appropriate team members based on skills and

availability

- Timeline Optimizer (GPT-4 Turbo): Adjusts task sequencing and timing to meet deadlines and

optimize resource usage

2\. Agent Communication Protocol:

- Implement a structured JSON message format for inter-agent communication
- Create a context management system to track the evolving workflow
- Design fallback mechanisms when agents reach token limits

3\. Token Optimization Strategies:

- Selective Context Pruning: Only pass relevant parts of context between agents
- Semantic Compression: Use embeddings to compress information
- Chunking: Break large processes into manageable chunks
- Streaming: Implement token streaming for large responses

4\. Model-Specific Optimizations:

- Use GPT-4 Turbo (128k context) for workflow generation and complex reasoning
- Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for high-throughput components like team analysis
- Implement GPT-4o for tasks requiring both text and image understanding
- Create a token budget management system to control costs

5\. Implementation Requirements:

- Each agent should have a dedicated class with prompt templates
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create proper error handling for API limits
- Track token usage for optimization
- Implement caching for repeated operations

The system should be able to take organization charts and project requirements as input and

produce detailed workflows with tasks assigned to team members, realistic timelines, and

dependencies. Ensure the architecture can handle incremental updates when users modify the

workflow.

Important Considerations

Environment Variables: After Phase 1, you'll need to set up:

OPENAI\_API\_KEY for OpenAI integration

Firebase configuration variables

GCP project ID and credentials


Model Usage Optimization:

GPT-4 Turbo is expensive ($15/1M tokens) - use selectively for complex reasoning

GPT-3.5 Turbo is more cost-effective ($0.50/1M tokens) - use for simpler tasks

GPT-4o offers a good balance of capabilities for multimodal needs

Implement token tracking to monitor costs


Technical Stack:

Frontend: React with TypeScript

UI Framework: Material UI

State Management: Context API + React Query

Database: Firestore on GCP

Authentication: Firebase Auth + Custom SSO

AI: OpenAI API with LangChain orchestration

Deployment: GCP Cloud Run


Testing Strategy:

Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next

Create sandbox environments for AI testing

Use mock data for organization charts and project requirements



By following this phased approach, you'll be able to incrementally build and test your enterprise

workflow management system, making adjustments as needed at each stage.RetryClaude does

setting up this prompt  and define these phases in cursorEditSetting Up Phases in Cursor for Your

Enterprise Workflow Project

When working with Cursor and its AI capabilities, you can effectively structure your development

into phases. Here's how to approach this:

Getting Started with Cursor and Project Setup

Install Cursor and Create Project Directory:

Download and install Cursor from cursor.sh

Open Cursor and create a new workspace/project folder


Initialize Your Project:

Open the terminal in Cursor (usually Ctrl+` or View > Terminal)

Run the following commands:

bashCopymkdir enterprise-workflow-app

cd enterprise-workflow-app

npx create-react-app . --template typescript

Initial Project Structure:

Create a phases directory to organize your development:

bashCopymkdir -p src/phases/phase1-auth src/phases/phase2-org-chart src/phases/phase3-

requirements src/phases/phase4-ai-workflow src/phases/phase5-jira-dashboard

src/phases/phase6-deployment


Using Cursor AI for Each Phase

For each phase, you can use Cursor's AI capabilities in several ways:

Method 1: Cursor's Chat Interface

Open the AI Chat in Cursor (usually by clicking the chat icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+L)

Type a prompt describing what you want to build for the current phase

For example:

CopyI'm working on Phase 1 of my enterprise app - the authentication system.

Create the necessary files for Firebase authentication with:

- Email/password with verification
- Google auth
- Enterprise SSO

Include React components, contexts, and TypeScript interfaces.


Method 2: Using Yolo Mode Directly in Files

Create a new file for a component, like src/phases/phase1-auth/AuthProvider.tsx

Use Yolo mode by typing a comment at the top of the file, describing what you want:

typescriptCopy// Create a comprehensive authentication provider component that:

// - Integrates with Firebase for email/password and Google auth

// - Supports enterprise SSO

// - Provides user context to the app

// - Handles conditional routing based on user state

// - Includes proper TypeScript typings

Let Cursor generate the implementation

Method 3: Using Inline Commands

While coding, you can use inline commands to get AI assistance:

Type `//" or "//"

Describe the functionality you need, like:

Copy// Implement the organization chart drag and drop interface with react-flow

Cursor will generate the code

Phase-by-Phase File Organization

For each phase, create these key files to help Cursor understand your structure:

Phase 1: Authentication

Copysrc/phases/phase1-auth/

??? README.md           # Document phase goals and components

??? AuthProvider.tsx    # Main authentication context

??? LoginPage.tsx       # Login component with multiple auth methods

??? RegisterPage.tsx    # Registration with email verification

??? VerifyEmail.tsx     # Email verification component

??? types.ts            # TypeScript interfaces for auth

??? index.ts            # Export all components

In the README.md, describe your phase:

markdownCopy# Phase 1: Authentication System

This phase implements:

- Multiple authentication methods (email/password, Google, SSO)
- Email verification with 6-digit OTP
- User profiles and organization associations
- Conditional routing based on user state

Key components:

- AuthProvider: Manages authentication state
- LoginPage: Handles different login methods
- RegisterPage: New user registration
- VerifyEmail: Email verification flow

Similar Structure for Other Phases

Follow the same approach for each phase, creating a clear README and key component files.

Testing Each Phase

For each phase, create a test harness to verify functionality:

typescriptCopy// src/App.tsx

import React, { useState } from 'react';

import { AuthProvider } from './phases/phase1-auth';

import { OrganizationChart } from './phases/phase2-org-chart';

// Import other phases as needed

function App() {

const [currentPhase, setCurrentPhase] = useState(1);

return (

<div className="App">

<div className="phase-selector">

<h2>Phase Testing</h2>

{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].map(phase => (

<button

key={phase}

onClick={() => setCurrentPhase(phase)}

className={currentPhase === phase ? 'active' : ''}

\>

Phase {phase}

</button>

))}

</div>

<div className="phase-content">

{currentPhase === 1 && (

<AuthProvider>

{/\* Phase 1 components \*/}

</AuthProvider>

)}

{currentPhase === 2 && (

<OrganizationChart />

)}

{/\* Other phases \*/}

</div>

</div>

);

}

export default App;

Best Practices for Working with Cursor

Be Specific in Prompts: Include details about:

Functionality required

Libraries to use

Patterns to follow

TypeScript typing requirements


Iterative Development:

Start with skeleton implementations

Use Cursor to expand or refine specific parts

Ask for improvements to existing code


Environment Setup:

Create a .env file for API keys and configuration

Use comments to explain to Cursor what each environment variable is for


Making the Most of Multi-Agent Architecture:

Create a dedicated src/ai directory for your multi-agent system

Document each agent's purpose and model requirements

Implement a controller that coordinates the agents



Example Prompt for Phase 1 Implementation

Here's a specific prompt you can use in Cursor's AI Chat to implement Phase 1:

CopyI'm building an enterprise workflow management system using React/TypeScript with Firebase

for authentication.

For Phase 1 (Authentication), please create the following files:

1. src/phases/phase1-auth/types.ts - Define interfaces for:
- User profiles with organization associations
- Authentication states
- Authentication methods (email, Google, SSO)

2\. src/phases/phase1-auth/AuthProvider.tsx - Create an authentication context provider that:

- Integrates with Firebase
- Handles all authentication methods
- Manages user state
- Provides login, logout, and registration functions
- Includes email verification with 6-digit OTP

3\. src/phases/phase1-auth/LoginPage.tsx - A login page component with:

- Email/password login form
- Google authentication button
- Enterprise SSO option
- Form validation and error handling

4\. src/phases/phase1-auth/RegisterPage.tsx - Registration component with:

- User information collection
- Email verification initialization
- Password requirements validation

Keep the code modular and use TypeScript for type safety throughout.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively use Cursor to implement each phase of

your enterprise workflow system, while maintaining a clear organization that makes it easy to test

and integrate each component.RetryClaude does not have internet access. Links provided may not
