Phase 4: AI Workflow Generation
Now let's implement the core AI workflow generation system:
Phase 4 Prompt for Cursor:
CopyLet's build the AI workflow generation module using OpenAI's API and a multi-agent architecture.

1. Set up OpenAI API integration:
   - Configure API key and model selection
   - Implement token usage tracking
   - Create fallback mechanisms for API limits

2. Design the multi-agent system:
   - Project analyzer agent (processes requirements)
   - Team analyzer agent (processes org structure)
   - Workflow generator agent (creates initial workflow)
   - Task assignment agent (matches tasks to team members)
   - Timeline optimizer agent (adjusts dates and sequences)

3. Implement prompt engineering for each agent:
   - Create structured prompts using collected data
   - Design system messages to guide agent behavior
   - Implement inter-agent communication patterns

4. Build the workflow visualization interface:
   - Interactive timeline with milestones
   - Task cards with assignments
   - Dependency visualization
   - Critical path highlighting

5. Create workflow editing capabilities:
   - Drag-and-drop timeline adjustments
   - Team member reassignment
   - Task modification
   - AI-assisted regeneration after changes

6. Implement vector database for context:
   - Use embeddings to store organizational knowledge
   - Create retrieval mechanisms for related projects
   - Build semantic search for workflow components

Use LangChain for agent orchestration and ensure all AI interactions are properly logged and monitored.
After implementing Phase 4, you should be able to:

Generate detailed workflows from project requirements
Visualize workflows with milestones and tasks
Assign tasks based on team structure and skills
Edit workflows and see AI-assisted updates
Track token usage and API costs
